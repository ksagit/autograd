We can look at the output of top for an uncheckpointed LSTM with sequence length 8. We see Python is
using about 78M of memory.

Let's bump up the sequence length to 512 and see what happens. 

'''
PID   COMMAND      %CPU  TIME     #TH   #WQ  #PORT MEM    PURG   CMPRS  PGRP PPID STATE

As we would expected, the memory demands are a lot higher. The checkpointed script does better.

Per iteration, the checkpointed LSTM takes about 4.60 seconds, while the uncheckpointed LSTM takes 
about 2.05 seconds. The checkpointed LSTM introduces 85 mb of memory over baseline, while the normal
LSTM introduces 284 mb of memory.
